# mixed = (1,2,3,4,5);
# for i in mixed:
#     print(i)

#create tuple with one element(use comma after the element)
# num = (1,)
# print(type (num))

#tuple unpacking
# name = ("smith","Arpan","Narayan","samjhana");
# name1,name2,name3,name4 = name

#list inside tuplee(we can use any list method in the list of the tuple)
# name = ("smith","Arpan",["Narayan","samjhana"]);
# print(name[2])

#min,max,sum
# mixed = (1,2,3,4,5);
# print(min(mixed))
# print(max(mixed))
# print(sum(mixed))
